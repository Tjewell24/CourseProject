#HIGH-Level Requirements
This project is a project for the MSSA program that accomplishes creating our own application as a single developer. 

#MVP

The applications minimum-viable product must have a interface that allows the user to click a button and be able to count. The user will need to be able to post that through the web that allows other users to see the clicks given. IF there is no counter there really is no app considering the app will be called "beer counter". There also needs to be the ability to choose what type of beer is being drank. So, todays top beers in some sort of database.

#FULL

The app should have the ability to click on a beer type and click a button to indicate a beer consumed. The user should be able to make a profile and be able to store data for the app previously used. It also should allow users to be able to communicate and chat on the application to "one up each other". The user should be able to access the app on their mobile phones

#STRETCH

- User can upload pictures 
- Have the ability to calculate the percentage/amount of alcohol they consumed, body weight, and let the user know their BAC (blood alcohol content)
- The application would be nice to have a list of social drinking games and how to instructions to play them.
